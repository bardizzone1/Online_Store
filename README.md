# Online_Store
An online store for purchasing different types of merchandise.

Introduction: 
Hi everyone! My web application project will be about creating an online store that people will be able to register and purchase different types of merchandise. I will be connecting a database to the web application that will be maintained with all the products and user information. 

Body: 

The online store will have merchandise for purchase, the ability to control inventory, and the ability for the user to *save for later* like the option that is available on Amazon. I will also have an administrator role that will be able to upload or remove merchandise, modify items and their descriptions, and view customer information that checkouts merchandise. 

Conclusion: 

This shopping system will provide 24/7 service to the customer to be able to surf the web application and place orders at any time. The system will be able to be updated and modified over time with upgrades and new implementations to the web application.




Front page:
This page includes a search feature, register account button, account settings icon, and a cart icon. This is the page the user will land on every time they access the website for the first time and it includes a featured item and a button to any clothes item they would like to go to whether it is womens, mens, jeans, new, or a current sale merchandise.

This second page in the wireframe is an image of a user that has gone to men -> shirts -> extra slim black shirt where they are currently browsing and have selected a tall size and extra small shirt and have hit the "add to cart" button.
